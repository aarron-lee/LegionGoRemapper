# Functionality

### This plugin uses the Lenovo-built remapping + bios functionality that's used for Legion Space, which means that this plugin can only do what Legion Space is capable of

This remapping plugin also only covers remapping for the X-input mode of the controller, it does NOT support FPS mode or D-input modes.

Included Functionality in this plugin:

- Manage RBG lights, including modes, brightness, cycle speed for certain modes, and RGB light color
- Back Button Remapping for Y1, Y2, Y3, M2, M3 (M1 is not supported)
- Enabling/Disabling the touchpad
- Gyro remapping to Left or Right Control Stick
- allow any of these settings on a per-game basis

# Install Instructions

### Prerequisites

Decky Loader must already be installed.

### Quick install

Run the following in terminal, then reboot

```
curl -L https://github.com/aarron-lee/LegionGoRemapper/raw/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Manual Install

add Udev rules to your device.

Create a file at `/etc/udev/rules.d/90-legion-go-remapper.rules`, and add the following to the file:

```
# allow r/w access by all local/physical sessions (seats)
# https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/4288
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="17ef", TAG+="uaccess"

# allow r/w access by users of the plugdev group
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="17ef", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0660"

# allow r/w access by all users
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="17ef", MODE="0666"
```

After saving the file, then run `sudo udevadm control --reload` in terminal.

Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/aarron-lee/LegionGoRemapper/releases)

Unzip the `tar.gz` file, and move the `LegionGoRemapper` folder to your `$HOME/homebrew/plugins` directory

then run:

```
sudo systemctl restart plugin_loader.service
```

then reboot your machine.

# Manual Build

- Node.js v16.14+ and pnpm installed

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aarron-lee/LegionGoRemapper.git

cd LegionGoRemapper

# if pnpm not already installed
npm install -g pnpm

pnpm install
pnpm update decky-frontend-lib --latest
pnpm run build
```

Afterwards, you can place the entire `LegionGoRemapper` folder in the `~/homebrew/plugins` directly, then restart your plugin service

```bash
sudo systemctl restart plugin_loader.service

sudo systemctl reboot
```

# Experimental Features

### Custom Fan Curves

### WARNING: If you don't properly cool your device, it can go into thermal shutdown! Make sure you set proper fan curves to keep your device cool!

Note that this is using the fan curve implementation in the Legion Go's bios. This may require additional bios update from Lenovo to become fully functional.

This method must be manually enabled. Once enabled, will use Lenovo's bios WMI functions to set fan curves. Requires Bios v28 or newer.

Note that this requires the `acpi_call` module, if your Linux distro doesn't have it pre-installed, it'll have to be manually installed.

Special thanks to [corando98](https://github.com/corando98) for investigating fan curves + writing the functions for to control it.

### Setup Instructions:

1. run `sudo modprobe acpi_call` in terminal, if this errors out, you need to install `acpi_call`
2. install latest LegionGoRemapper from github [releases](https://github.com/aarron-lee/LegionGoRemapper/releases)
3. edit the `$HOME/homebrew/settings/LegionGoRemapper/settings.json` file. add `"forceEnableCustomFanCurves": true` to the json

The end result in the `settings.json` file should look something like this:

```
{
  "forceEnableCustomFanCurves": true,
  ...otherStuffAlreadyHere
}
```

4. reboot

# Troubleshooting / Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I set RGB LEDs separately between the Left and Right LEDs?

Due to a controller firmware update, Lenovo disabled the ability to set the LEDs separately.

If you are on the older firmware, you can manually enable separate LED management by adding the following to your `$HOME/homebrew/settings/LegionGoRemapper/settings.json`:

```
forceEnableSeparateLedManagement: true
```
